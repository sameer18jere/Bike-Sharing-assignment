# Bike Sharing Assignment
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

* ### General Info:
 Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

* ### Conclusions:
The demand for bikes is high during below situations:
1) Temperature conditions are better (i.e. in the range of 10 to 30)
2) Windspeed is less (since there is a negative correlation with windspeed)
3) Demand for bikes is higher during summer, fall and winter seasons.
4) People prefer bike sharing when the climate condition is clear (no heavy rains, no thunderstorms,no snow etc.)
5) Working day, the demand is higher as people generally opt for bike sharing with office colleagues. Whereas during holiday they prefer to go by personal vehicles with family or friends.
6) There is negative correlation of bike sharing during misty climate because people fear accidents due to bad vision during foggy climate.
7) Also, we can see a negative correlation of bike sharing during light snow rains.
